(What we did, what we did it: the rationale behind design decisions, architecture, etc.)


With convenience in mind, {App_Name} was designed as a status bar app. We made the decision to build it this way early on in the process. {App_Name}'s position in the main menu bar allows it to be readily accessible at all times. 






Tesseract Integration notes:

In the case of a "Precompile Bridging Header" error relating to OCR, you may need to make updates to the relevant build settings, which can be found under "Swift Compiler - General."

Make sure that the path to "ocrTooI-Bridging-Header.h" is set properly.
